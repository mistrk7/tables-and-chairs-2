## Tables and Chairs 2
#### A remake of Axel's Tables and Chairs for 1.21 versions. WIP!

#### Setup:
This datapack needs to be compiled with [Beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet) and [Bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt).  
Then you'll be able to see both the resource pack and the data pack in the [ build ] folder.  
Follow this tutorial to get set up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOS-OnqE4GY  
It's not as complicated as it sounds üëç.
