There are 12 materials of wood in MC.

--- Chiseled Models ---
Each chiseled material has their own model.
11 existing models + 1 new for pale oak.


--- Notes ---
Tables are made up of two entities;
	1. " *mat*Table " () - The legs of the model. Has 4 variants using the hammer. Has logic.
	2. " Item Display " - The model that hides the trapdoor. Is constant.

Chairs are made up of two entities;
	1. " Item Display " - Display
	2. " Interaction " - Logic
	note - might want to displace model when setting up seat position and combine those things there

(feature) - Should set tables automatically in this order.
	1. Check surrounding tables in + formation
	2. Update them using the four models, in four different directions (16 in total)
	3. Use a bitmask to set them correctly (chatgpt)

The four leg models: Full, one-edge, one-corner, none
Secondary four leg models: Full, post-side, post-wall, none

Make a Netherite gold chair
Consider the remaining quartz, stone_brick, deepslate, blackstone, blackstone_brick, endstone, obsidian variants. Maybe copper variants all around?

Don't forget about chair carpets, these things can be added as it gets worked on.

-- Reversion Plan ---

When you want to get rid of the datapack, I want there to be a promise that NOTHING WILL BREAK. 
So here's the logic for how we could have something convert tables & chairs back into vanilla blocks.

- Save the positions of every table and chair placed in storage.
- When reverting, march through each one.
	1. Teleport to the nearest furniture, while saving your old position and going into spectator. Has to be done because block replacements need to be in range.
	2. Replace all furnitures with block-equivalents in a 12-block range, removing changed ones out the list. Also means conversion needs to happen with a 12-block render distance minimum.
	3. When no more can be found, move over to a next batch, and repeat step 2 until we're all clear.

Will be organised into categories, [Overworld]>[Tables]+[Chairs], [Nether]>[Tables]+[Chairs], [End]>[Tables]+[Chairs], and will loop through respectively.

Large items when holding them.
Tables as shields?


--- Table destruction idea ---

Check for tables without a block in them every two seconds
Trigger an advancement when damage is dealt to an axe, on the off-chance it is destroyed with one, so that it looks better.
