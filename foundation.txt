--- Notes ---
Tables are made up of two entities;
	1. " *mat*Table " () - The legs of the model. Has 4 variants using the hammer. Has logic.
	2. " Item Display " - The model that hides the trapdoor. Is constant.

Chairs are made up of two entities;
	1. " Item Display " - Display
	2. " Interaction " - Logic
	note - might want to displace model when setting up seat position and combine those things there

(feature) - Should set tables automatically in this order.
	1. Check surrounding tables in + formation
	2. Update them using the four models, in four different directions (16 in total)
	3. Use a bitmask to set them correctly (chatgpt)

The four leg models: Full, one-edge, one-corner, none
Secondary four leg models: Full, post-side, post-wall, none

Don't forget about chair carpets, these things can be added as it gets worked on.
